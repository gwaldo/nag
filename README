##nag - a command-line timer and reminder

`nag` is a small utility that will take in an amount of time in minutes and/or
seconds, and an optional message.  When the time elapsed, it will print the
message to the screen.  If you're running a Mac, and didn't pass the Quiet
flag (-q, --quiet), it will use the `say` command to speak your message.

The defaults are:

* Wait time in Minutes: 0
* Wait time in Seconds: 0
* Message: "HEY!"
* Quiet: false

If you call `nag` without any parameters, it will wait 0 minutes and 0 seconds,
and then print "HEY!" to STDOUT.
